# todo_app

A new Flutter project.

A to-do app in Flutter involves setting up a Flutter project, designing the UI with Flutter widgets, and implementing state management for tasks. Key components include a Task model, local storage for persistence, and functions for task CRUD operations. The app should offer sorting and filtering options, provide visual feedback, and undergo testing for functionality and performance. Deployment includes publishing to app stores, with considerations for accessibility, localization, and analytics. Continuous updates and maintenance ensure the app remains responsive to user feedback and evolving needs.
